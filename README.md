# Zendesk Support Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_zendesk_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
<!--section="zendesk_source_model"-->
- Materializes [Zendesk Support staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_github_source/#!/overview/zendesk_source/models/?g_v=1) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zendesk#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Zendesk Support data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zendesk) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Name columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Zendesk Support data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_zendesk_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Zendesk Support transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zendesk).
<!--section-end-->

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- A Fivetran Zendesk Support connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following zendesk_source package version in your `packages.yml` file **only if you are NOT also installing the [Zendesk Support transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zendesk)**. The transform package has a dependency on this source package.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/zendesk_source
    version: [">=0.11.0", "<0.12.0"]
```
## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your target database and the `zendesk` schema. If this is not where your Zendesk Support data is (for example, if your zendesk schema is named `zendesk_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    zendesk_database: your_destination_name
    zendesk_schema: your_schema_name 
```
## Step 4: Disable models for non-existent sources
This package takes into consideration that not every Zendesk Support account utilizes the `schedule`, `domain_name`, `user_tag`, `organization_tag`, or `ticket_form_history` features, and allows you to disable the corresponding functionality. By default, all variables' values are assumed to be `true`. Add variables for only the tables you want to disable:
```yml
vars:
    using_schedules:            False         #Disable if you are not using schedules
    using_domain_names:         False         #Disable if you are not using domain names
    using_user_tags:            False         #Disable if you are not using user tags
    using_ticket_form_history:  False         #Disable if you are not using ticket form history
    using_organization_tags:    False         #Disable if you are not using organization tags
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations
<details open><summary>Collapse/Expand configurations</summary>

### Add passthrough columns
This package includes all source columns defined in the macros folder. You can add more columns from the `TICKET`, `USER`, and `ORGANIZATION` tables using our pass-through column variables, which will persist these custom fields to the `stg_zendesk__ticket`, `stg_zendesk__user`, and `stg_zendesk__organization` models, respectively.

These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, but not required. Datatype casting is configured via a sql snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired sql while omitting the `as field_name` at the end and your custom pass-through fields will be casted accordingly. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

```yml
vars:
  zendesk__ticket_passthrough_columns:
    - name: "account_custom_field_1" # required
      alias: "account_1" # optional
      transform_sql: "cast(account_1 as string)" # optional, must reference the alias if an alias is provided (otherwise the original name)
    - name: "account_custom_field_2"
      transform_sql: "cast(account_custom_field_2 as string)"
    - name: "account_custom_field_3"
  zendesk__user_passthrough_columns:
    - name: "internal_app_id_c"
      alias: "app_id"
  zendesk__organization_passthrough_columns:
    - name: "custom_org_field_1"
```

> Note: Earlier versions of this package employed a more rudimentary format for passthrough columns, in which the user provided a list of field names to pass in, rather than a mapping. In the above `ticket` example, this would be `[account_custom_field_1, account_custom_field_2, account_custom_field_3]`.
>
> This old format will still work, as our passthrough-column macros are all backwards compatible.

### Mark Former Internal Users as Agents
If a team member leaves your organization and their internal account is deactivated, their `USER.role` will switch from `agent` or `admin` to `end-user`. This will skew historical ticket SLA metrics, as we calculate reply times and other metrics based on `agent` or `admin` activity only.

To persist the integrity of historical ticket SLAs and mark these former team members as agents, provide the `internal_user_criteria` variable with a SQL clause to identify them, based on fields in the `USER` table. This SQL will be wrapped in a `case when` statement in the `stg_zendesk__user` model.

Example usage:
```yml
# dbt_project.yml
vars:
  zendesk_source:
    internal_user_criteria: "lower(email) like '%@fivetran.com' or external_id = '12345' or name in ('Garrett', 'Alfredo')" # can reference any non-custom field in USER
```

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the zendesk staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_zendesk_source`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Zendesk Support staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    zendesk_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See this project's [dbt_project.yml](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zendesk_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    zendesk_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```

### 🚨 Snowflake Users
If you do **not** use the default all-caps naming conventions for Snowflake, you may need to provide the case-sensitive spelling of your source tables that are also Snowflake reserved words. 

In this package, this would apply to the `GROUP` source. If you are receiving errors for this source, include the below identifier in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    zendesk_group_identifier: "Group" # as an example, must include the double-quotes and correct case!
```
